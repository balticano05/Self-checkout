# Self-checkout
Develop a desktop self-checkout application using C# and WPF in JetBrains Rider. The app will streamline purchasing by allowing customers to manage their own checkout, similar to retail self-checkout systems. Features include adding products to a cart, applying discounts, and finalizing purchases. Use CSV files for the database.
